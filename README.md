#Neuroking
A neural network design tool, now at version 0.1.0.0! <br />
Readme last updated on 2016-06-18. <br />

Neuroking aims to accomplish two things: <br />
1) Make it easy for anyone to utilize the power of machine learning <br />
2) Allow people to share their creations with others <br />

In my opinion, it should be possible to accomplish these goals while making the source code available. <br />
If it becomes popular, I aim to allow people to monetize their modules in an app-store style. <br />

The basic structure is more or less ready, but will most likely go through a couple of reiteration cycles to ensure maximal quality. <br />

Since this is a project which I'm only working on during my free time, it will most likely take a while to flesh out new features... However, said features will definitely be full of awesome. <br />

There's not a whole lot going on yet, but stay tuned! <br />

##Roadmap
Planned for 0.2:
- Create Systems - they will manage the network and optimize the parameters to maximise a fitness function.
- Nodes with optimizable parameters
- Nodes which pass values between 0.0 and 1.0 along the network
- Weak and strong connections

Planned for 0.3:
- Systems should be configurable
- More node types
- Automated and easily expandable test suite

Planned for 0.4:
- More representations of output data (graphical RGB, graph, output to file)
- The ability to save each generation's data

Planned for 0.5:
- Output generation-by-generation data into customizable "graphs" (exportable data points are sufficient)
- More ways to input (previous gen, rows from a file, part of the screen as RGB values)
