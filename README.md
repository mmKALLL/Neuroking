#Neuroking
A neural network design tool, now at version 0.1.0.0! 
Readme last updated on 2016-06-18.

Neuroking aims to accomplish two things:
1) Make it easy for anyone to utilize the power of machine learning
2) Allow people to share their creations with others

In my opinion, it should be possible to accomplish these goals while making the source code available.
If it becomes popular, I aim to allow people to monetize their modules in an app-store style.

The basic structure is more or less ready, but will most likely go through a couple of reiteration cycles to ensure maximal quality.

Since this is a project which I'm only working on during my free time, it will most likely take a while to flesh out new features... However, said features will definitely be full of awesome.

There's not a whole lot going on yet, but stay tuned!

##Roadmap
Planned for 0.2:
- Create Systems - they will manage the network and optimize the parameters to maximise a fitness function.
- Nodes with optimizable parameters
- Nodes which pass values between 0.0 and 1.0 along the network
- Weak and strong connections

Planned for 0.3:
- Systems should be configurable
- More node types
